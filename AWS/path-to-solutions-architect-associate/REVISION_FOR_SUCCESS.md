#### Last-Minute Review

___

1. `Exam Tips`: It's a great idea to run through those exam tips the day before the exam. Focus on areas you feel the
   least comfortable with.
2. `Practice Exam`: Run through a few practice exam questions. You will be doing this for a while, so limit it to a
   couple.
3. `Take a Break`: Think about something non-AWS related. Ride a bike, read a book, let your brain rest. You have
   prepped and are ready. Trust yourself.
