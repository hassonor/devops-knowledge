#### Serverless Benefits

___

* `Ease of Use`: There isn't much for us to do besides bringing our code. AWS handles almost everything for us.
* `Event Based`: Serverless compute resources can be brought online in response to an event happening.
* `Billing Model`: "Pay as you go" in its purest form. You only pay for your provisioned resources and the length of
  runtime.

#### Exam Tip

* On the exam, focus on answers that move away from `unmanaged architecture like EC2`.
* It's almost always `better to select an answer on the text that uses Lambda or containers` rather than a traditional
  operating system.
