#### Latency Routing Policy

___
Allows you to route your traffic based on **the lowest network latency for your end user** (i.e., which region will give
them the fastest response time).

#### Exam Tips:

* Route 53 sent the traffic to `eu-west-2` because it has much lower latency than `ap-souteast-2`.
