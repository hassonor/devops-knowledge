#### The 3 W's of Scaling

____

* **What**: What do we scale? We have to decide what sort of resource we're going to scale. How do we define the
  template?
* **Where**: Where do we scale? When applying the model, where does it go? Should we scale our database? Or WebServers?
* **When**: When do we scale? How do we know we need more? CloudWatch alarms cen tell us when it's time to add more
  resources.
