#### What Is Kinesis Video Streams?

___

* If you need stream media content from a large number of devices to AWS and then run `analytics`, `ML`
  and `other processing`, consider using Kinesis Video Stream. A perfect example of this is Ring.
* Kinesis Video Streams elastically scales to millions of devices and then stores, encrypts an indexes video data in
  your streams. You can then access your data through easy-to-use APIs.

#### Use Cases:

1. `Smart Home`: Think Amazon Ring. You can stream video content from your Ring devices to Kinesis Video Streams and
   then run analysis on the data.
2. `Smart City`: Many cities have devices like CCTV cameras at traffic lights and junctions that can be monitored
   automatically using Kinesis Streams.
3. `Industrial Automation`: You can use Kinesis Streams to ingest time-encoded data (e.g, LIDAR and RADAR signals and
   temperature sensors) and then provide industrial automation.
