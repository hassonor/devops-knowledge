### Exam Tips - What to Remember When Using Roles

1. **The Preferred Option**: Roles are preferred from a security perspective.
2. **Avoid Hard-Coding Your Credentials**: Roles allow you to provide access without the use of access key IDs and
   secret access keys.
3. **Policies**: Policies control a role's permissions.
4. **Updates**: You can update a policy attached to a role, and it will take immediate effect.
5. **Attaching and Detaching**: You can attach and detach roles to running EC2 instances without having to stop or
   terminate those instances.
