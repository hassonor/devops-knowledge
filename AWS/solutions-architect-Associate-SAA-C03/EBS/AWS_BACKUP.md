* **Consolidation**: Use AWS Backup to back up AWS services, such as EC2, EBS, EFS, Amazon FSx for Lustre, Amazon FSx
  for Windows File Server and AWS storage Gateway.

* **Organizations**: You can use AWS Organizations in conjunction with AWS Backup to back up your different AWS services
  across multiple AWS accounts.

  for your data. You get better compliance, as you can enforce your backup polices, ensure you backups are encrypted,
  and audit them once complete.
