* `Sentiments analysis`
* `Index and search product reviews`
* `Legal brief management`
* `Process financial documents`

#### Where to Use Kendra?

* If you have a scenario question about machine learning to build an intelligent search service using unstructured
  text... Think `Amazon Kendra`.

#### Textract

### Amazon Forecast

___

* If you have a scenario-based question where you need to analyze time-series data and make predictions based on that
  analysis... Think of `Amazon Forecast`.

#### Fraud Detector

___
Look for scenarios where you are asked to build a fraud detection machine learning model that is highly customized based
on your data.

#### When to Use Transcribe

___

If you see a scenario about using machine learning to convert video and/or audio to text (e.g, generating closed
captioning)...Think `Amazon Transcribe`.

#### Lex

#### Where do I use  Amazon Rekognition?

___

* If you have a scenario question about content moderation using AI/ML... Think `Amazon Rekognition`.

#### Sagemaker

___

* `Ground Truth`: Set up and manage labeling jobs for training datasets using active learning and human labeling.
* `Notebook`: Access a managed Jupyter Notebook environment.
* `Training`: Train and tune models
* `Inference`: Package and deploy your machine learning models at scale.

1. `Create a Model`: This is the place that will provide predictions for your endpoint.
2. `Create an Endpoint Configuration`:
    * This is where you specify the model to use, interface instance type, instance count, variant name and weight.
    * This can sometimes be called a production variant.
3. `Create an Endpoint`: This is where the model is published, and you can invoke the model using the `InvokeEndpoint()`
   method.

#### Translate

___
If you have a scenario-based question where you need to translate from one language to another using deep
learning/neural networks, think of `Amazon Translate`.
